  <h2 style="color:Purple">Programming Experience</h2>

  <hr>

  <p>- I started learning python during the COVID-19 Pandemic and love it! <br>
    - I have made a couple games such as snake, pong, and crossy road <br>
    - I have made a couple of mathematical and scientific programs which include <br>
    a binary star tracker, Polynomial operations class, Imaginary Numbers Class, a <br>
    password manager app, a flash-card app that teaches French, a quote generator, and <br>
    many more<br>
    - I have also dabbled in data analysis using pandas and csv files<br>
    - I have also programmed a US States Trivia Game<br>
    - I am most proud of one program: A weather alert app. This app makes an API call to a<br>
    weather service provider and returns a JSON while where the weather data code is extracted. <br>
    Using the Twilio SMS API and PythonAnywhere task runner, I send messages every morning at 6 <br>
    to me and my parents that tells us what the weather for the day will be.
